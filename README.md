# PyVot : Python Variational Optimal Transportation
This is a collection of codes for computing semi-discrete Monge optimal transportation (OT) through the variational method.

We name our method *variational optimal transportation* (VOT) or *variational Wasserstein clustering* (VWC).

* Given the empirical distributions (marginals) and the initial centroids, 
the vinilla VWC compute VOT and then update the centroids to the centers of mass.
The whole process will converge in one iteration. Our method is immune to unbalance measures.

* When there are two or more marginals, 
we are computing a discrete Wasserstein barycenter, usually with free support and fixed 
measure to simplify the problem. When there are two marginals, the results can
be used to solve the optimal transshipment problem.
  
* Monge OT maps exist in general when the marginals are continuous. 
In practice, we consider a collection of dense Dirac samples as an approximation.
  
* Our OT formulation is convex. Yet, this program only uses the 1st order gradient
 because the 2nd order gradient involves computing convex hulls which is intractable 
 for high-dimensional data.
 
* The picture below shows 10 random nested ellipses averaged according to the 
Euclidean distance (left) and the Wasserstein distance (right). More examples 
can be found in [demo/](demo/).
