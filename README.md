# PyVot : Python Variational Optimal Transportation
This package includes the prototype code for computing Monge's optimal transportation (OT)
 and Wasserstein clustering.

* Variational Wasserstein clustering in each iteration leverages variational principles [1]
 to solve optimal transportation. Thus, we name the package PyVot instead of PyVWc for the
  sake of pronunciation. For computing optimal transportation, simply set the max iteration to one.
* Monge's OT maps exist in general when one of the distributions is absolutely continuous. 
In practice, we consider a collection of dense Dirac samples as an approximation.  
* This program implements gradient descent instead of Newton's method to avoid computing
 convex hulls so that it can handle high-dimensional data. 
* The picture below shows 10 random nested ellipses averaged according to the Euclidean distance (left) and the Wasserstein distance (right) as computed by our method. Middle is the Euclidean sum after re-centered. Our method also preserves the topology (rainbow colors) of the ellipses. 
* More examples can be found in [demo/](demo/).
